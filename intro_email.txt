Hi everyone,

Thank you for registering for the upcoming workshop at CU Boulder! We're very excited to have you with us next week. Our hope is that the tools and skills you'll learn over the course of the workshop will help improve and accelerate your work.

We've been tailoring the usual Software Carpentry curriculum so it better fits your needs as librarians. It is very useful for us to know about your background in order to adjust the lessons to the skill level of the group. This information is also helpful for improving instructor training and in Software Carpentryâ€™s perpetual search for funding. Please fill out this survey as soon as you can: http://goo.gl/forms/IfVEP89TWE. We would greatly appreciate your participation!

The hands-on nature of the Carpentry workshops require that participants install certain software on their laptop before the workshop. Please try to install the necessary software (as listed on the "setup" section of the workshop website: http://mperignon.github.io/2015-08-06-cuboulder/) *before* you arrive on the first day, since some of the downloads might take a bit of time. The installation process should be straightforward, but if you hit any snags, we're happy to help - please send questions to perignon@colorado.edu or come to the room early and we'll help troubleshoot the installation process. To check that the installation worked, see the instructions on the workshop Etherpad: https://etherpad.mozilla.org/2015-08-06-cuboulder.

We look forward to seeing you soon!

Cheers,
Mariela Perignon
